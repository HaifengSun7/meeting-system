[ Version 2.0.00 By James. Nov24, 2020 ]

    - Status:
        Working on mandatory change 5.

    - Fixed:
        Can set maximum number of people in events when being created.
        Changed form of speakers in events into ArrayList<String> So that multi speaker is accepted.
        Event save file now:
        example of a Single Speaker Event:
            1,1,5,2020-05-03 14:00:00.0,1,hi,Speaker1

        explanation:
         Room Number  Max # of Speakers  Max # of Attendees         time,           length  Description  Users in it
               1              1                  2           2020-05-03 14:00:00.0     1         hi       Speaker1

    - Haven't Done:
        Availability of setting maximum number of attendees for events.
        Checking whether the maximum exceeds capacity of room.
