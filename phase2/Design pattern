We've used Builder, Façade, Factory.

Factory
In EventManager, we create the eventFactory which can output different types of events.
And we used that in method addUserToEvent, so whatever the user enters, we will create a correct event type.

Façade
Our UserSystem(and its subclasses) delegate the operations to EventManager, UserManager, MessageManager, and RequestManager.
