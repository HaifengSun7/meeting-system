To run the program, go to >src >Main.

Assumptions: All events (or “talks”) are 1 hour long. Meetings have to start after 9 a.m. and ends before 5 p.m.
No comma is allowed in event descriptions.

All inputs are done through command line.
Usually, commands are surrounded by square brackets. For example, “Input [e] to quit the system” requires the user to input “e” and press enter to send the line. “[3] Send a message” requires the user to input “3” and press enter to send the line. All inputs in the main menu are done this way.
Another type of input is “press enter to do something”. User is required to press down enter, while other inputs are almost always ignored.
Finally, the last type of input is “Enter something to do something”. Here, user is required to enter a simple command, which is usually “username”, “password” or “serial number”.

For your ease, we have created some users, events, rooms and messages for testing. Please keep in mind that logging in is case sensitive.
